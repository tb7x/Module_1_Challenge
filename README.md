# This process is automated to help companies to value loans.
# Loops and variables are used to automate the loan portfolio summaries.
# Using the len() function and sum() funtion the process calculates the total number of loans in the list and the total price of the loans.
# Conditional statements were used to decide whether the loan was greater than or equal to the cost or if it was less than the cost.
# A new function was created to calculate the present value of a new loan using specified parameters.
# A copy of the data was sent to a CSV using csvwriter.
